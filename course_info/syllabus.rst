CSCI 8945: Advanced Representation Learning
-------------------------------------------

**Semester**: Fall 2025  
**Credits**: 3  
**Prerequisites**: Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Machine Learning Fundamentals

Course Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This course provides an in-depth exploration of advanced representation learning techniques, 
from classical methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to modern deep learning approaches. 
Students will gain both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills through 
hands-on tutorials and projects.

**Attendance**
Regular attendance is expected. Tutorial sessions are particularly important as they 
provide hands-on experience with the concepts.

**Late Work**
Late assignments will be penalized 10% per day unless prior arrangements are made.

**Academic Integrity**
All work must be your own. Collaboration on concepts is encouraged, but implementations 
and writeups must be individual unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**Accommodations**
Students with disabilities who may need accommodations should contact the Office of 
Disability Services to verify their eligibility for reasonable accommodations.
